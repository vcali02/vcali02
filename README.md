### üéì Education 
I graduated from the Flatiron School with over 450+ hours of training in Software Development and developed and contributed to over 5 projects throughout my education.
I also graduated with a Masters Degree in Behavior Analytics from Arizona State University, and completed over 1,500 hours of applied field work before taking a board exam to become a Board Certified Behavior Analyst. This educational foundation, combined with my practical experience, equips me with data analytic skills, innovative problem-solving skills, and fortified soft skills such as resilience, communication, and perseverance. 

### üå± Activity and Collaboration
I'm eager to connect with software and technology professionals, collaborate on exciting projects, and continue growing in ways I never imagined possible. 

### ‚ú®Let's connect and explore opportunities together!
